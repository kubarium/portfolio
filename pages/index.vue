          Iâ€™m Kumsal Obuz â€” a multidisciplinary developer, writer, and educator with <strong>20+</strong> years of
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve worked across continents and industriesâ€”from building enterprise websites to
          designing game mechanics and authoring technical books. Iâ€™m driven by a deep respect for clarity and
          usability, and I strive to make technology more human through thoughtful design, clean code, and purposeful
          documentation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether Iâ€™m crafting interactive UIs, simplifying complex systems, or mentoring the next wave of developers, I
          bring a unique blend of creativity and precision to every project.

        <h2 class="text-2xl py-4">Career Highlights</h2>
        <p>
          In 2020, I founded
          <em>
            <a href="https://viroidgames.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">
              Viroid Games
            </a>
          </em>,
          an independent studio that transitioned into a consulting practice for small teams. Iâ€™ve delivered strategy
          guidance, creative support, and B2B content while continuing hands-on development and mentorship. During this
          period, I also authored
          <em>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Development-Blender-Godot-point-click/dp/1801816026" target="_blank"
              rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">
              Game Development with Blender and Godot
            </a>
          </em>
          (Packt), turning complex workflows into digestible, beginner-friendly instruction.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond development, Iâ€™m deeply invested in education and community. At OCAD University, I designed and taught
          <em>Low Poly Game Art</em>, helping students at various levels navigate technical concepts with confidence and
          creativity. I also founded the <em>Godot Toronto</em> community to foster learning and connection between
          developers.
